<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the markdown and files needed to reproduce the analyses and visualizations found in [Farahani, A., Miller, M.J., Porter, B.W., Dawson, T. and Routledge, B. 2023. Stable isotopes of archaeological and modern semi-terrestrial crabs (Potamon potamios) provide paleoecological insights into brachyuran ecology and human resource acquisition in late Holocene Jordan. Quaternary International 658: 14-23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618223000733).

In brief, our research sought to identify whether or not stable inorganic isotopes derived from crab carapaces recovered at the archaeological site of Khirbet al-Mudayna al-Aliya, located in south-central Jordan and dated to ca. 1000 BCE, could be used as hyper-local climate proxies.  The short answer is: no.  But the longer answer is: because of the behavioral ecology of these [specific semi-terrestrial freshwater crabs ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potamon_potamios), stable inorganic oxygen and carbon isotopes give us insight into past brachyuran paleoecology and human resource acquisition, especially this past community's foraging behavior.

See the compiled analyses and figures **<a href = "http://thebalkarchaeology.com/markdowns/KMAcrabs.html" target = "_new"> here</a>**.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Data Description

There are two folders, one for data, and another for the Markdown.  See descriptions below:

### Files

- `KMA Potamon Archaeological Measurements and Isotopes.csv`
: The physical measurements of archaeological remains of brachyurans from KMA, including the stable inorganic isotope readings derived from those same remains conducted at UC Berkeley's [Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry](https://nature.berkeley.edu/stableisotopelab/).

- `KMA Potamon Archaeological NISP.csv`
: The counts of the different archaeological brachyuran remains recovered at KMA by archaeological context.

- `KMA Potamon Modern Crab Locations.csv`
: The GPS coordinates of the sampled contemporary *Potamon potamios* specimens in the wadi system beneath KMA.

- `KMA Potamon Modern Measurements and Isotopes.csv`
: The physical measurements of all contemporary *Potamon potamios* specimens measured in the wadi system beneath KMA.  In addition, this file includes the stable inorganic isotope readings derived from sampled specimens (V<sub>PDB</sub>) and the water of the pools from which they were sampled (V<sub>SMOW</sub>).  These analyses were conducted at UC Berkeley's [Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry](https://nature.berkeley.edu/stableisotopelab/).

- `KMA Potamon Modern Water Locations.csv `
: The GPS coordinates of the sampled pools that contained the *Potamon potamios* specimens in the wadi system beneath KMA.

### Markdown

- `Supplement.Rmd`
: An (R) Markdown that allows for interactive reproducibility of all of the figures and tables found in the manuscript, plus some additional analyses.

- `Supplement.html`
: A compiled version of the Markdown in the event you just wanted to <a href = "http://thebalkarchaeology.com/markdowns/KMAcrabs.html" target = "_new"> look at the analyses and figures </a>.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Prerequisites and Use

You will need:

- [Rstudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

- [R > v. 4.2.0](https://www.r-project.org/)

The packages needed for markdown compilation are listed at the beginning of the (R) markdown.
